# Node Upgrade Documentation

[Node Upgrade Site](https://yonatanzax.wixsite.com/cloud-runtime-node18) 
This is our way to see that previously requireable modules are required in the new node-version as well

## Introduction
This documentation provides a detailed guide for two essential processes in our project: **Installing Native Modules Locally** and **Taring cloud-npm-downloader**.

## Installing Native Modules Locally
### Why Install Native Modules Locally?
Native modules contain binary files that can vary between different Node.js versions. To ensure that those modules we'll work in the new node version, we need to re-install the native modules locally for the targeted Node.js version.


## Taring cloud-npm-downloader Guide
### Why Tar cloud-npm-downloader?
Tarring the cloud-npm-downloader directory is essential for packaging and distribution. It allows us to bundle all necessary components into a single compressed file, ensuring easy deployment and versioning.
